Following basically Tech With Tims Youtube tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD4qAhfFuLo

The goal is to futher enhance my understanding with Python and Pygame, so that I can venture deeper into the world of game developement.

# After finishing the project
If you want to test my version yourself, be sure to have pygame and tkinter installed.

I changed the code from the video somewhat because it did not follow the PEP-Style-Guide.
I am also pretty sure that there are still some things that do not follow the PEP-Style-Guide.
Overall the video itself is pretty good and helps to understand how to code some of the game logic and how to use pygame a bit.

By the way, I have seen some of "Tech with Tim"s videos and all of them were pretty good, so I recommend that you check out his channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg
(The snake video itself was on another channel for which he made it.)
